# What is NerveNetwork?

NerveNetwork aims to connect all isolated blockchains and establish a cross-chain asset exchange network, providing all necessary underlying support for the DeFi ecosystem. Let every digital asset holder experience a truly safe, free and transparent DeFi service.

## The Significance of NerveNetwork
NerveNetwork establishes a universal blockchain cross-chain interaction protocol. Through this standardized protocol conversion layer, developers can match the universal interface standards, integrating more mainstream digital assets and forming a set of universal cross-chain interaction protocols. By following the standard interface to develop a module, which is then validated and upgraded by virtual banks and consensus nodes, it can be integrated into the NerveNetwork cross-chain interaction protocol.

NerveNetwork provides a new intelligent lightning network for mainstream digital assets like BTC. Bitcoin transactions have long confirmation times and high fees, but through NerveNetwork, users can initiate quick transactions with low fees, achieving second-level confirmations. Most mainstream digital assets, such as BTC, lack smart contracts, making decentralized applications like collateralized lending and decentralized exchanges infeasible on their native chains. NerveNetwork facilitates these applications and ecosystems easily.

NerveNetwork opens the closed-loop blockchain of mainstream digital assets, allowing quick transfer to various blockchains within the NULS ecosystem. Each blockchain is like a local area network where assets can only circulate within the closed loop. NULS, as a blockchain infrastructure builder, allows for asset circulation across blockchains built using its modules by simply configuring the cross-chain module. NerveNetwork aims to connect other network structure types of local area networks, such as BTC/ETH.

NerveNetwork offers a multi-asset, open, and transparent value interaction platform, providing underlying support for the DeFi application ecosystem. Centralized platforms, like exchanges and centralized financial wallets, can misuse your assets, creating a black box where the safety of your assets cannot be guaranteed. On NerveNetwork, an asset trading platform can be built where all data is open and transparent. Your assets are controlled through multi-signature by the cross-chain virtual bank, ensuring their safety.
