# A Guide of Yield Farming on Nerve Consensus using Nabox App

The token output mechanism on Nerve consensus is quite unique, think of it as a farming pool that continuously generates tokens by adding supported liquidity pairs and NVT tokens on its main net.

There are 4 LP tokens and one single coin that are supported to stake in Nerve mainnet, **the LP tokens are NVT_USDTN_LP、NVT-ETH_LP、NVT_BNB_LP、NVT_NULS_LP, the single token is NVT token.**

To be noted is that **liquidity providers get more rewards** than single coin stakers.

This article will explain how to add liquidity on Nerve main net **using Nabox mobile wallet**. The liquidity **pair we are using today is NVT-BNB**.

# To get ready :

1. Set up your Nabox wallet account. Nabox wallet can be downloaded at [**https://nabox.io/**](https://nabox.io/)
