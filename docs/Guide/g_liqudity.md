# Adding Liquidity and Farming on NerveSwap

We have deployed some LP farming pools on NerveSwap where our users can stake NULS-NVT LP to min NABOX and NULS-EHT LP to earn EHT. But considering that some users are not experienced well enough in DeFi field, here goes this article guide, we hope this can be some useful educational material on your DeFi journey!

**This article will summarize how to add NULS-NVT LP and Farm on NerveSwap using Nabox mobile app.**

**Make sure you do the following before you provide liquidity:**

* Set up your Nabox wallet account. (Nabox wallet can be downloaded from [nabox.io](http://nabox.io/))
* Make sure you **have enough assets to add liquidity** (NVT, NULS) on **NerveChain.**
* If your NULS and NVT are being kept in other networks (BSC), you need to **crosschain NULS and NVT to NerveChain before adding liquidity.**
* Search NerveSwap on Nabox and enter the DApp.
* Click “**Discover**” — Search “**NerveSwap**” — ”**Generate L2 address**”.

Note: you will be asked to generate an L2 address for authorization for the first time entering.
