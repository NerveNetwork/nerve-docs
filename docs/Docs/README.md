# Nerve Introduction

Nerve is a decentralized network of digital asset services and a blockchain cross-chain interaction protocol based on NULS microservice framework and developed with NULS ChainBox.   
It aims to break the isolated value island of the blockchain, establish a cross-chain asset interaction network, and provide all the necessary underlying support for the Defi application ecology.   

Let every digital asset holder enjoys the real security, freedom, and transparency of the Defi application services.   

Through the Nerve cross-chain interaction protocol, only a small amount of development is needed through the standard interface, and then the blockchain with different structures can be transformed into a set of common asset types that can be identified by the cross-chain modules in the NULS ecosystem.   

In this way, we can achieve the asset interaction inside and outside of the NULS ecosystem, and provide rich Defi scenarios for mainstream digital assets such as BTC.
